  "description": "Teaches students about how to design, analyze, and program algorithms and data structures.  The course emphasizes parallel algorithms and analysis, and how sequential algorithms can be considered a special case.  The course goes into more theoretical content on algorithm analysis than 15-122 and 15-150 while still including a significant programming component and covering a variety of practical applications such as problems in data analysis, graphics, text processing, and the computational sciences.  NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer  Science course.",
